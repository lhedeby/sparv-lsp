# sparv-lsp README

This is the vscode extension for the programming language [Sparv](https://github.com/lhedeby/sparv). It is mostly a simple 
implementation of [LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) but it has a few more features aswell.

## Features

- suggestions
- formatting
- error highlighting 

## Requirements

The [Sparv](https://github.com/lhedeby/sparv) language must be installed and added to your $PATH. This is needed for the lsp to work.


## Troubleshooting

If you are having trouble with the extension it is most likely because vscode does not have access to the ```sparv``` command.
Make sure that sparv is correctly added to your $PATH. You can try typing ```sparv``` in the vscode terminal to see if its available.
